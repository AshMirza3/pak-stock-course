<h2>Key Ratios & Metrics</h2>
<p>
  Once you extract raw numbers from financial statements, compute ratios to compare companies. Common ratios:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings):</strong> Market Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS).  
      <ul>
        <li>A high P/E may indicate growth expectations; a low P/E could signal undervaluation or trouble.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book):</strong> Market Price per Share ÷ Book Value per Share.  
      <ul>
        <li>Book Value = (Total Assets − Total Liabilities) ÷ Shares Outstanding.</li>
        <li>A P/B below 1 might indicate the stock trades below net assets; above 1 may imply premium valuation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity):</strong> Net Income ÷ Shareholder Equity.  
      <ul>
        <li>Measures profitability relative to invested equity. Healthy Pakistani banks often target ROE > 15%.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Annual Dividend per Share ÷ Market Price per Share.  
      <ul>
        <li>Investors seeking income often look for yields > 5% from stable companies.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> MCB Bank has EPS of PKR 15, stock price PKR 200 → P/E = 13.3×. If Book Value = PKR 100, P/B = 2×. If dividend = PKR 10 per share, yield = 5% on PKR 200 stock price.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Compare ratios within the same industry—banking vs. textile ratios can differ drastically; direct cross-sector comparisons may mislead.</p>
