<h2>Venture Capital & Private Equity in Pakistan</h2>
<p>
  Beyond public markets, Pakistani startups and medium-sized enterprises raise capital via venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE). Lakson’s VC arm and other players include:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lakson Venture Capital:</strong> Focuses on early-stage tech startups—FinTech, e-commerce, healthtech. Provides not only capital but mentorship and network access.</li>
    <li><strong>i2i Ventures:</strong> Karachi-based VC focusing on pre-seed and seed rounds—invests in tech founders across Pakistan.</li>
    <li><strong>Karandaaz Pakistan:</strong> A public-private partnership that provides risk capital for SMEs and women entrepreneurs.</li>
    <li><strong>Pak-n-Tel Ventures:</strong> Corporate VC arm of PTCL, investing in telecom and digital services startups.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How VC/PE Investments Work:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Seed Round:</strong> Startups raise PKR 5–20 million in exchange for 5%–15% equity. Early backers take high risk for potentially >10× returns.</li>
    <li><strong>Series A/B:</strong> After product-market fit is proven, Series A (~PKR 50 million+) or Series B (~PKR 200 million+) rounds focus on scaling operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit:</strong> VCs exit via acquisition by a larger company, secondary share sale, or IPO (on PSX if company grows large enough—rare but possible, e.g., Systems Ltd.’s spinout).</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Case in Point:</strong> Lakson VC invested PKR 20 million in FinTech startup “Tabadul Pay” in 2021 (Seed Round). By 2024, Tabadul Pay had processed PKR 15 billion in transactions—Lakson’s stake appreciated ~5× in valuation. In 2025, Tabadul plans to apply for an IPO on PSX to raise additional growth capital.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> VC/PE carries very high risk. Limited partners (LPs) commit capital for 5–7 years before an exit. Retail investors can get indirect exposure via PE-focused mutual funds (e.g., Lakson’s Private Equity Fund).</p>
