<h2>What is a Stock Market?</h2>
<p>
  A stock market is a centralized venue where investors can buy and sell shares (stock) of publicly listed companies. Companies list shares to raise capital; investors purchase shares to gain ownership and potential dividends. As supply and demand change, share prices fluctuate—reflecting the market’s collective sentiment about a company’s future earnings.

  In Pakistan, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is the primary marketplace for equity trading. Investors place buy/sell orders through licensed brokers; these orders are matched electronically on the exchange’s order book. Trades settle on a T+2 basis (meaning settlement occurs two business days after the trade date).

<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Stocks represent fractional ownership in a company. The exchange provides liquidity, transparency, and a mechanism for price discovery via buyer and seller interactions.</p>
