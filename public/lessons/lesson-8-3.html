<p>
  Over five years, LEF generated a cumulative return of ~61%, while KSE-100 returned ~49%. This outperformance is due to:
  <ul>
    <li>Active stock selection—Lakson’s research avoided highly leveraged energy stocks in 2022 downturn.</li>
    <li>Sector weighting—higher allocation to defensive sectors (FMCG, pharmaceuticals) when markets were volatile.</li>
    <li>Timely profit-booking—reduced exposure before major corrections, locking in gains.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Active management can add alpha in inefficient markets like PSX.</li>
    <li>However, high expense ratios (1.5%–2%) can erode outperformance if not monitored closely.</li>
    <li>Diversify across multiple AMCs—don’t rely on a single fund to outperform every cycle.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Before investing in any equity fund, compare its rolling 3- and 5-year returns vs. benchmark and other funds, adjusting for risk (standard deviation).</p>
