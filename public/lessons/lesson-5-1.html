<h2>What Is a Mutual Fund?</h2>
<p>
  A mutual fund pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Professional fund managers handle day-to-day trading, research, and asset allocation according to the fund’s stated objective.

<p>
  <strong>Key features:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Even with small capital (e.g., PKR 5,000), you gain exposure to dozens of stocks or bonds, reducing idiosyncratic risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Open‐end mutual funds allow you to buy/redeem units at Net Asset Value (NAV) on any business day.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Management:</strong> Experienced portfolio managers and research analysts make buy/sell decisions based on comprehensive analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> Management fee (often 1%–2% annual), sales load (front-end/exit load), and operational expenses are deducted from returns.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Why invest via mutual funds?</strong>  
<ul>
  <li>If you lack time or expertise to analyze individual stocks, mutual funds provide expertly curated portfolios.</li>
  <li>Some funds specialize in Shariah-compliant stocks, fixed-income, or balanced strategies—choose based on your risk profile.</li>
</ul>
