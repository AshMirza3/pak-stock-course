<h2>Common Indicators</h2>
<p>
  Indicators help quantify trends and momentum. Widely used ones:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Moving Average (SMA):</strong> Average of closing prices over N periods (e.g., 50-day SMA). If price crosses above 50-day SMA, it might signal bullish momentum.</li>
    <li><strong>Exponential Moving Average (EMA):</strong> Similar to SMA, but gives more weight to recent prices (e.g., 12-day & 26-day EMAs used in MACD).</li>
    <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Oscillator between 0–100.  
      <ul>
        <li>RSI > 70 = overbought (potential pullback).</li>
        <li>RSI < 30 = oversold (potential rebound).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):</strong> Difference between 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA.  
      <ul>
        <li>The “signal” line (9-day EMA of MACD) helps identify crossovers (bullish/bearish).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> SMA ± 2 standard deviations.  
      <ul>
        <li>When bands contract (low volatility), a breakout often follows.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> On a daily chart of MCB Bank, if the 14-day RSI dips below 30 and then rises above 30, that may signal a potential buy opportunity from an oversold condition.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Combine indicators (e.g., RSI + MACD) for confirmation rather than relying on one alone.</p>
