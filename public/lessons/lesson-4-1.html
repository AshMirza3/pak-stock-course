<h2>Chart Types and Patterns</h2>
<p>
  Technical analysis uses price charts to identify patterns. Common chart types:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Line Chart:</strong> Plots closing prices over time. Simple, but lacks intra-day detail.</li>
    <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar shows open, high, low, close (OHLC) for a period.  
      <ul>
        <li>Top of the bar = high, bottom = low, tick on left = open, tick on right = close.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Candlestick Chart:</strong> Similar to bar charts, but uses a “body” for open/close and “wicks” for high/low.  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bullish Candle:</strong> Closing price > opening price (often colored green).</li>
        <li><strong>Bearish Candle:</strong> Closing price < opening price (often colored red).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Basic Patterns:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Support & Resistance:</strong> Horizontal levels where price repeatedly bounces (support) or fails to breach (resistance).</li>
    <li><strong>Double Top / Double Bottom:</strong> Reversal patterns—two peaks (double top) or two troughs (double bottom).</li>
    <li><strong>Head & Shoulders:</strong> Reversal pattern: left shoulder, head (higher peak), right shoulder.</li>
    <li><strong>Trendlines:</strong> Diagonal lines connecting successive lows in an uptrend or highs in a downtrend.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> On a daily candlestick chart of HBL, a round of three candles forming a “head & shoulders” near PKR 150 might signal a bearish reversal toward PKR 140 support.</p>
