<h2>Margin Trading & Leverage</h2>
<p>
  Margin trading allows you to buy shares using borrowed funds from your broker—amplifying returns (and losses). If you have PKR 100,000 and broker offers 2:1 margin, you can purchase up to PKR 200,000 worth of stock by borrowing PKR 100,000.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How it works:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>You deposit PKR 100,000 as collateral (margin deposit).</li>
    <li>Broker lends you additional PKR 100,000 to buy shares.  
      <ul>
        <li>Typically, brokers charge a margin financing rate (e.g., 15% annualized).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If stock price rises 10% from PKR 100 to PKR 110 on a PKR 200,000 position, your gain = PKR 20,000. After paying interest on the borrowed PKR 100,000 (say PKR 3,000), net gain = PKR 17,000 → 17% return on your PKR 100,000 capital.</li>
    <li>If stock price falls 10% from PKR 100 to PKR 90, your loss = PKR 20,000. You still owe interest, so your net loss could be ~PKR 23,000 → 23% loss on your capital.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Risks & Margin Calls:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>If your position’s value falls below a certain maintenance margin (often 30%–40%), broker issues a margin call—demanding you deposit more funds or sell shares to reduce leverage.</li>
    <li>Failure to meet margin call can result in forced liquidation of your holdings at unfavorable prices.</li>
    <li>Highly risky in volatile markets like PSX—reserve margin trading for experienced traders only.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you use margin, monitor your positions daily. Set automatic stop-loss limits to limit downside risk.</p>
