<h2>Asset Allocation for Pakistani Investors</h2>
<p>
  Asset allocation is dividing your portfolio among different asset classes—equities, fixed income, cash, and possibly commodities. In Pakistan, typical retail investors focus heavily on equities; however, a balanced allocation may look like:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Equities (40%–60%):</strong> Direct stocks or equity mutual funds (LEF, AGP Islamic Stock Fund).</li>
    <li><strong>Fixed Income/Bonds (20%–30%):</strong> Government bonds, corporate Sukuk, income funds (LIF).</li>
    <li><strong>Money Market/Cash (10%–20%):</strong> Money Market Funds (LMMF, ULP) or bank fixed deposits.</li>
    <li><strong>Commodities (0%–10%):</strong> Gold exposure—via physical, PKR-denominated gold contracts, or gold ETFs (e.g., PSX’s KSE Gold Index).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Factors to consider:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Age & Risk Tolerance:</strong> Younger investors can afford more equity risk; retirees may prefer fixed income and cash.</li>
    <li><strong>Investment Horizon:</strong> For a 5+ year horizon, equities fetch higher returns (~15%–20% historically), whereas bonds yield ~12%–14%.</li>
    <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Pakistan’s inflation often >10%. Aim for at least inflation+3% real return by mixing equities and income instruments.</li>
    <li><strong>Currency Risk:</strong> If you hold foreign assets (e.g., US stocks), you’re exposed to PKR depreciation risk. Most retail investors stick to PKR assets to avoid FX risk.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Sample Portfolio:</strong> A 30-year-old might have:
  <ul>
    <li>60% equities (30% direct stocks, 30% equity mutual funds)</li>
    <li>25% fixed income (corporate bonds, income funds)</li>
    <li>10% money market funds</li>
    <li>5% gold exposure</li>
  </ul>
</p>
