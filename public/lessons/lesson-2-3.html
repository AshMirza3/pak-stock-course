<h2>Brokerage Houses & How to Choose One</h2>
<p>
  To trade on PSX, you must open an account with a licensed brokerage. Key considerations:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reputation & Track Record:</strong> Look for established firms: 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lakson Investments:</strong> Pakistan’s largest independent asset manager, also offering brokerage services via affiliates. Known for strong research coverage and robust online platform.</li>
        <li><strong>JS Global Capital:</strong> Provides TraderPlus platform—popular for its user-friendly interface and research reports.</li>
        <li><strong>AKD Securities:</strong> Emphasizes advisory services and corporate finance; strong institutional client base.</li>
        <li><strong>Arif Habib Securities:</strong> Highly liquid order book; one of the oldest brokerage houses in Pakistan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Brokerage Fees & Commissions:</strong> Typically a percentage of trade value (often 0.035%–0.05% each side), plus SECP fee, Exchange Fee, and VAT. Compare total cost structures across brokers.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology & Platform:</strong> If you prefer online trading, evaluate mobile/web platforms for real‐time quotes, charting, order placement, and ease-of-use.</li>
    <li><strong>Research & Advisory:</strong> Some brokers include daily market analysis, sector reports, and stock recommendations—useful for beginners.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Support & Branch Network:</strong> In-person support can be helpful for new investors; check if there’s a local branch near you.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>How to Open an Account:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill out a KYC (Know Your Customer) form—provide CNIC, proof of address, and a passport-size photo.</li>
    <li>Submit a copy of CDC investor account form (available online or at branch).</li>
    <li>Deposit initial margin (often PKR 10,000 minimum) into your brokerage account.</li>
    <li>Receive login credentials for your online trading portal, or paper contract notes if transacting offline.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want Shariah-compliant trading, ensure the broker offers screening against Shariah-compliant lists (e.g., KMI-30 constituents).</p>
