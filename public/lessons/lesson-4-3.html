<h2>How to Use Technical Analysis on PSX Stocks</h2>
<p>
  Let’s walk through a quick example using a popular Pakistani bank—MCB Bank (Ticker: MCB):
  <ol>
    <li>Open your online charting platform (e.g., JS Global’s TraderPlus, or a free site like TradingView).</li>
    <li>Load MCB’s daily candlestick chart for the last 6 months.</li>
    <li>Overlay the 50-day and 200-day SMA:
      <ul>
        <li>If the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA (“Golden Cross”), that’s often a bullish signal.</li>
        <li>If the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA (“Death Cross”), that’s bearish.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Check RSI on a 14-day basis:
      <ul>
        <li>If RSI is above 70, MCB may be overbought—proceed with caution on new longs.</li>
        <li>If RSI is below 30, MCB could be oversold—watch for reversal signs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Draw support/resistance lines by connecting swing lows (support) and swing highs (resistance). If price repeatedly bounces near PKR 150, that’s a strong support level.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Case Study:</strong> In February 2025, MCB’s price formed a double bottom at PKR 147, RSI dipped to 28, then rebounded above 30. Shortly after, price rallied toward PKR 160, validating the oversold bounce.</p>
