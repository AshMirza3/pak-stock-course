<h2>Taxation & Regulatory Filings</h2>
<p>
  Understanding taxes on trading is crucial:
  <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resident Individual (Unlisted Shares):</strong> Exempt if held > 12 months; otherwise 15% on gains if sold within 12 months. (Not applicable to PSX shares—only unlisted companies.)</li>
    <li><strong>Resident Individual (PSX Shares):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Until Junê30, 2023: Exempt for all holding periods.</li>
        <li>From July 1, 2023 onward, SRO rules may reintroduce CGT on PSX trades depending on holding period (>1 year exemption). Check SECP notifications for updates.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Non‐Resident Investor:</strong> 15% on profit from PSX trades, withheld at source by CDC.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Withholding Tax & Stamp Duty:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Withholding (WHT) on Dividend Income:</strong> 15% for resident individuals (unless exemption certificate); 30% for foreign individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Stamp Duty:</strong> 0.02% of trade value or PKR 10 minimum per side (broker-dealer enters and pays; automatically deducted).</li>
    <li><strong>SECP Fee:</strong> 0.001% of trade value (collected by broker).</li>
    <li><strong>Exchange Fee:</strong> 0.0115% of trade value.</li>
    <li><strong>CDC Fee:</strong> 0.0002% on equity cross transactions.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Filings:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annual Tax Returns:</strong> Report capital gains/losses in your annual Income Tax Return (ITR) to FBR.</li>
    <li><strong>Form C for Foreign Investors:</strong> If you’re a foreign investor, provide Form C to claim reduced WHT under Double Taxation Agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>CDSR Annual Statement:</strong> CDC issues an annual summary—list of dividend income, CGT, and WHT paid—helpful for ITR filing.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always keep contract notes and CDC statements. Consult a tax advisor, as rules can change frequently.</p>
