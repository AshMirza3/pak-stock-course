<h2>PSX Structure & Trading Hours</h2>
<p>
  The Pakistan Stock Exchange operates on a standardized schedule, with two main sessions:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Opening Session (9:15 AM – 9:30 AM):</strong> Orders are entered but not matched. This allows participants to revise orders before the opening auction.</li>
    <li><strong>Opening Time (9:30 AM):</strong> Orders from the pre‐open book are matched at the equilibrium price, determining the first trade price.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Trading (9:30 AM – 3:30 PM):</strong> Market operates with live order matching. All market, limit, and special orders execute based on price/time priority.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Settlement follows a T+2 cycle—meaning if you buy shares on Tuesday, the trade officially settles (funds and shares exchange) on Thursday.
</p>
