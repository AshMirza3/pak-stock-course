<h2>Using SIPs & Systematic Investment Plans</h2>
<p>
  A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (e.g., monthly) into a mutual fund. SIPs harness rupee‐cost averaging, which smooths out market volatility.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How SIP works:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>You choose an equity or balanced fund (e.g., Lakson Equity Fund).</li>
    <li>You commit PKR 5,000 every month—regardless of net asset value (NAV).</li>
    <li>When markets dip, PKR 5,000 buys more units (lower NAV); when markets rise, fewer units (higher NAV). Over time, average cost per unit stabilizes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Benefits:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> Forces saving and investing consistently.</li>
    <li><strong>Rupee-Cost Averaging:</strong> Mitigates impact of short-term volatility.</li>
    <li><strong>Compounding:</strong> Monthly returns reinvested build a larger corpus over 5–10 years.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Example Scenario:</strong> If you start a PKR 5,000/month SIP in Lakson Equity Fund in January 2021 at NAV PKR 10 (500 units), and the NAV falls to PKR 8 in June (625 units), by December NAV = PKR 12 (417 units). Your total units after 12 months might be ~6,000 units. If NAV in January 2022 is PKR 15, corpus = 6,000 × 15 = PKR 90,000, even though you invested only PKR 60,000.
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start early and remain invested—SIPs work best over 5+ years for equity funds due to market cycles.</p>
