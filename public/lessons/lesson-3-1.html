<h2>Reading Financial Statements</h2>
<p>
  Fundamental analysis begins with understanding a company’s financial statements. Three key statements:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Tracks revenue, expenses, and profit over a period (quarterly/annually). Key line items: 
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue (sales)</li>
        <li>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</li>
        <li>Operating Expenses (Opex)</li>
        <li>Net Profit (after tax)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time. Key line items:
      <ul>
        <li>Assets (current & non-current)</li>
        <li>Liabilities (current & non-current)</li>
        <li>Equity (share capital, retained earnings)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Shows actual cash inflows/outflows in operating, investing, and financing activities. Helps you verify that “profit” translates into real cash generation.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Example (HBL Ltd.):</strong>  
<ul>
  <li>Revenue increased from PKR 300 billion to PKR 350 billion year-on-year.</li>
  <li>Net profit margin stabilized around 20%, indicating strong cost control.</li>
  <li>Operating cash flow was positive PKR 50 billion, showing healthy liquidity.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Always cross-verify net profit with operating cash flow—high profits on paper may not reflect actual cash generation if receivables rise excessively.</p>
