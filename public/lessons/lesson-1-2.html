<h2>History of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)</h2>
<p>
  The PSX, as it exists today, is the result of a 2016 merger between three regional exchanges: the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), Lahore Stock Exchange (LSE), and Islamabad Stock Exchange (ISE). The consolidation aimed to unify regulations, reduce operational costs, and improve market depth.

  <strong>Key milestones:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1947:</strong> Karachi Stock Exchange (originally established in the 1930s under British rule) becomes a major trading venue post-independence.</li>
    <li><strong>1977:</strong> Nationalization period under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government led to state control of many brokerages, slowing market growth.</li>
    <li><strong>1991 onward:</strong> Privatization and liberalization fueled renewed investor interest. KSE 100 Index launched to benchmark top companies.</li>
    <li><strong>2016:</strong> KSE, LSE, and ISE merge into a single Pakistan Stock Exchange. Demutualization completed in 2017—members own shares in PSX’s operator.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Today, PSX is the country’s only exchange, trading equities, debt securities, and derivatives with over 550 listed companies and daily volumes often exceeding PKR 20 billion.</p>
