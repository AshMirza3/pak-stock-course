<h2>Industry Analysis in Pakistan</h2>
<p>
  Pakistan’s economy is driven by several key sectors. Understanding macro trends and industry fundamentals is crucial:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Banking:</strong> The largest sector by market cap on PSX. Major players: HBL, MCB, UBL, ABL. These banks generate stable earnings through interest income and fee-based services. Monitor interest rate changes from SBP (State Bank of Pakistan), NPL (Non-Performing Loans) ratios, and CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio).</li>
    <li><strong>Textiles:</strong> Pakistan’s top export industry. Leading textile firms: Nishat Mills, Gul Ahmed, Kohinoor Textile. Watch yarn prices, cotton crop output, and global demand (especially US/EU). Currency fluctuations can heavily affect profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Utility and power generation companies: Hub Power Co., K-Electric, Lalpir Power. Their profitability often ties to fuel costs (RFO, RLNG) and circular debt issues. Recent government reforms can improve receivables.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer Goods:</strong> Companies like Unilever Pakistan, Nestlé Pakistan, and Engro Food. Consumer staples tend to be stable but face margin pressures from sugar, packaging, and fuel costs.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Macro Indicators:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> Slower GDP growth can dampen corporate earnings across sectors. Pakistan’s GDP growth hovered around 4% pre-2022, slowed due to inflationary pressures.</li>
    <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> High inflation (often >20%) erodes purchasing power and corporate margins.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> SBP’s policy rate influences banking spreads. A 12% policy rate can compress net interest margins for lenders.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always cross-check macro data from reliable sources like SBP’s Quarterly Reports and the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics before drawing conclusions.</p>
