<h2>Diversification Concepts</h2>
<p>
  Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, or geographies to reduce risk. In Pakistan, sector concentrations can be high, so a diversified approach helps mitigate idiosyncratic risk.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Owning only banking stocks: If regulatory changes or an economic slowdown hit banks, your entire portfolio suffers.</li>
    <li>Spreading across industries (banking, textile, energy, consumer goods) helps cushion against sector-specific shocks.</li>
    <li>Geographic diversification: While most Pakistani retail investors stay local, investing in a mutual fund with some exposure to international securities can further reduce risk.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you have PKR 100,000. Instead of putting it all in one bank stock like HBL, you could allocate:
  <ul>
    <li>30% in banking (e.g., HBL, MCB)</li>
    <li>20% in textile exporters (e.g., Nishat Mills)</li>
    <li>20% in energy (e.g., Hub Power Co.)</li>
    <li>15% in consumer goods (e.g., Unilever Pakistan)</li>
    <li>15% in a money market fund (e.g., LMMF) for stability.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid “putting all eggs in one basket”—choose at least 4–6 sectors, or invest via a balanced mutual fund for automatic diversification.</p>
